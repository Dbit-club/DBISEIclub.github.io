									“One cubic inch of nanotube circuitry, once fully developed, would be up to one hundred million times more powerful than the human brain.” — Ray Kurzweil
								</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								Building an IoT system requires a team effort. A basic IoT team includes an electrical engineer, a mechanical engineer, an industrial designer, an embedded systems designer, one back-end developer, one front-end developer, and a product manager. The more knowledge each member of the team has about the role of every other team member, the purpose of the system, and the end-user of the system, the better the entire system will function.<br>
								With the scale of opportunity of learning and growing together with such a massive moment lurking around the corner, it is never too late to orient oneself with the world of IoT, especially in a country like India. With many, a problem to solve, and a population of 356 million between the ages of 10 and 24 (according to a UN report), the world’s largest youth population should be encouraged to make use of these favorable circumstances.<br>

							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Purpose:</b>
								<ol>
									<li>Hardly anyone has experience with an IoT function</li>
									<li>You need to define your function--not just the work you do</li>
									<li>IoT is a project, but it can be a product</li>
									<li>Small projects are best</li>
									<li>Don't underestimate integration</li>
									<li>Every project needs a vision</li>
									<li>Communicating project progress is critical</li>
									<li>You should work quickly and decisively to regain your momentum when projects don't work</li>

									<li>Artificial Intelligence is impacting the future virtually. It has been the main driver of emerging technologies.</li>
									<li>AI and ML are appealing to know more and challenging to work on.</li>
									<li>We, as a team, should believe in the 3 Rs:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Right Start</li>
										<li>Right Organization and</li>

							<b>Blockchain technology is a form of digitalized, de-centralized public record of all cryptocurrency transactions.</b><br>
							Blockchain was designed to record, not just financial-related transactions, but virtually everything of value. <br>
							I'll say it's gold for nerds . It is fascinating how blockchain technology works. That's what keep me up to know more about it.<br>
							The need for decentralization is the key motivation behind the blockchain technology, 
							and decentralization is achieved by distributing the computation tasks to all the nodes of the blockchain network.<br>

							Why is Blockchain Popular?
							<ul>
								<li>Blockchain can be used for secure transaction (end to end) with out any third party app</li>
								<li>Blockchain is a digital ledger that is gaining a lot of attention and traction.</li>
								<li>Blockchain can be used to store the data (As a database which is secured)</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								Most people assume Blockchain and Bitcoin can be used interchangeably, but in reality, that’s not the case. 
								Blockchain is the technology capable of supporting various applications related to multiple industries like finance, 
								supply chain, manufacturing, etc., but Bitcoin is a currency that relies on Blockchain technology to be secure.<br>
								<b>Purpose</b>
								<ul>
									<li>To analyse blockchain use cases in both financial and non-financial fields.</li>
									<li>To generate new ideas and to be familiar with the current affairs related to blockchain</li>
								</ul>
								<b>Facilities</b>
								<ul>
									<li>Resources to enhance knowledge on Blockchain Technology.</li>
									<li>Programming Languages and software : Python, Solidity, Java etc. </li>
									<li> Learn more about Ethereum and daApps</li>
								</ul>
